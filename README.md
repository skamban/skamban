<h1>Hi, I'm Sruthi Kamban! <br/><a href="https://github.com/skamban">Programmer</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/skamban/">Passionate Full Stack Developer | .NET | Azure | Microservices</a></h1>

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª About Me</h2>
I'm a .NET Full Stack Developer. I‚Äôm passionate about solving real-world problems through code, and I strongly believe in continuous learning and staying current with the latest in tech.
My core expertise includes .NET Core, C#, ASP.NET MVC, Microservices, Azure Cloud Services, SQL Server, and modern frontend frameworks like React. I‚Äôve worked extensively on enterprise-grade systems, secure browser-based applications, and system modernization projects.
 I'm currently exploring microservices architecture, cloud-native development, and contributing to full-stack projects like Superfan Tees ‚Äì A CSK Fan Store, where I use React + .NET Core + Azure to build production-ready applications.
 I enjoy designing clean architecture, working with CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps), writing unit-tested code (MSTest/NUnit), and diving deep into system design and cloud-native patterns.
  Always curious, always improving ‚Äî I‚Äôm ready to learn anything new that helps me build better software and grow as an engineer.
